A search server based on Lucene, Elastic Search is a way to organise data and make it readily accessible. A highly scalable, distributed, full-text search engine. Coded completely in java and published as open source under the terms of Apache Licence, it is the most popular enterprise search engine used by giants on the web like facebook, wikipedia, stumbleupon etc. It includes advances in speed, security (with shield plugin), scalability and hardware efficiency out of the box.


Elastc Search is a tool for querying words, its principal task being to return text similar to a given query and statistical and liguistic analysis of it. A standalone database server, communable only through RESTful API's, it takes data and optimises the data according to language based searches and stores it in a sophisticated manner. It supports clustering, and multiple shards out of the box. It makes for an excellent tool.
